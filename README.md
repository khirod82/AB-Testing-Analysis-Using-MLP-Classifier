### Title: **AB Testing Analysis Using Machine Learning**

### Explanation:  
This project employs A/B testing to evaluate and compare two user groups (A and B) on a website, analyzing their interaction patterns based on features such as page views, time spent, device type, location, and conversion rates. By preprocessing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features, the project trains a machine learning model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier to classify users into their respective groups.

### Inference:  
- The model achieved an accuracy of 52.9%, indicating limited success in predicting user group membership.  
- Precision and recall scores suggest a moderate imbalance in the dataset or difficulty in classifying certain group behaviors.  
- Further improvement could involve optimizing feature selection, hyperparameter tuning of the MLP model, or employing alternative classification algorithms.

### Potential Applications:  
The insights gained from this project can guide decisions related to web design, marketing strategies, and targeted user engagement efforts.
